# Flipper-WatchDogs-XFW

This was once a fork of @ClaraCrazy's [Flipper-Xtreme](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme/) firmware, but this WatchDogs Asset Pack is now part of it!

This repo will now only keep the assets for those interested, but they are included and available in XFW so go use that instead!
